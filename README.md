- 👋 Hi, I’m @warphunter, a gray-haired man with some fresh ideas ;)
- 👀 I’m a command line guy, interested in creating faster, multi-threaded tools for Unix and Linux (and occasionally Windows).
- 🌱 Now I'm finalizing my big "pandemic project", where I wrote a multi-threaded file search program in C (like find(1)), that currently compiles on AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, Linux.  I have never touched a Windows compiler in my life, so I use Linux and MinGW to compile it for Windows :)
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on improving my tools, and ideas for more multi-threade tools are welcome :]
- 📫 I can be reached at jornv@1337.no
